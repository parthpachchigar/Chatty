This is an example of a basic client server setup using 
netty and protobuf for the transport and serialization.

Your task is to get the code to build and run through
two terminals (a client and a server).

Technologies introduced:
1. Netty
2. Protobuf
3. JAXB


To Start Client:
	$ ./runClient.sh



To Start Server (on 4 different host):

	on host 1
	$ ./startServer.sh resoures/route-1.conf
	
	on host 2
	$ ./startServer.sh resoures/route-2.conf
	
	on host 3
	$ ./startServer.sh resoures/route-3.conf
	
	on host 4
	$ ./startServer.sh resoures/route-4.conf
